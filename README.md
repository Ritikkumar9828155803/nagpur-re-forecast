# 🏠 Nagpur Real Estate Analytics & Forecasting Dashboard

An end-to-end data science project that scrapes real estate listings, performs data cleaning and analysis, builds price forecasting using Facebook Prophet, and presents insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes residential real estate trends in Nagpur by:

- Scraping property listing data
- Cleaning and transforming raw data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Forecasting price per square foot using Prophet
- Building an interactive multi-page Streamlit dashboard

The application enables users to:

✔ View locality-wise price metrics  
✔ Compare different localities  
✔ Visualize price distributions  
✔ Forecast future price trends  
✔ Download cleaned datasets

# 🧪 Data Pipeline

## 1️⃣ Web Scraping
Property data was collected from:

- MagicBricks
- 99acres
- Housing.com

Fields scraped:

- Locality  
- Property type  
- Price  
- Area (sqft)  
- Price per sqft  
- Scrape date  

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced During Scraping


Scraping MagicBricks using BeautifulSoup was challenging due to:

-Dynamic content loading: Many listings are rendered via JavaScript, so they were not available in the static HTML fetched using requests.

-Frequent HTML structure changes with deeply nested <div> elements and non-semantic class names, which made selectors unstable.

-Pagination handling required manual URL parameter modification and validation of each response.

-Bot detection (HTTP 403 errors) on repeated requests, which was mitigated using custom headers and time delays.

-Inconsistent data formats (₹, Lac, Crore; sqft vs sqyrd) that required extensive cleaning and normalization.

Scraping was performed at a low request rate and strictly for academic purposes.

# 🔄 Data Preprocessing

- Converted price strings → numeric
- Standardized area units → sqft
- Removed duplicates and missing values
- Created `avg_price_per_sqft`
- Created locality-level aggregated statistics

Output datasets:

- `nagpur_real_estate_cleaned.csv` → row-level data  
- `locality_stats.csv` → metrics for dashboard  
- `forecast_summary.csv` → Prophet forecast output  

---

# 📊 Forecasting Approach

Since scraped data is cross-sectional (not true time-series):

- Simulated locality-wise time series
- Applied **Facebook Prophet**
- Generated:
  - Trend
  - Forecast
  - Confidence intervals
  - Growth percentage

Forecast summary includes:

- Current price
- Forecasted price
- % growth
- Trend direction
